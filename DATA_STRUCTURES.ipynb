        "- Membership Testing: Checking if an element is present in a set (x in my_set) is significantly faster than checking in a list (x in my_list). Sets use a hash table for storage, enabling constant-time membership tests, as opposed to a list's linear search. If you need to frequently check for the presence of items, use a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Set Operations: Sets support efficient mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference. These operations are computationally expensive on lists but optimized for sets. If you need to perform set operations (e.g., finding common users in two lists), sets are the way to go.\n",
